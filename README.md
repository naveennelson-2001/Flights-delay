✈️ Flights Delay Analysis

📌 Overview

This project analyzes flight delay data to uncover trends, causes, and patterns affecting airline punctuality. Using Python in Google Colab, the analysis explores how factors such as airline, weather, time of year, and route impact flight delays.

🎯 Objectives

Clean and preprocess raw flight delay datasets
Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify delay trends
Visualize patterns using charts and graphs
Detect correlations between delay time and influencing factors
Provide data-driven insights for operational improvements

🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools

Python (Pandas, NumPy)
Matplotlib, Seaborn (Data Visualization)
Google Colab (Development Environment)
CSV Datasets (Public flight delay data)

📊 Key Insights

Seasonal peaks in flight delays during holiday travel periods
Weather-related delays show strong correlation with certain regions
Specific airlines/routes exhibit higher average delay times
Evening flights are more prone to delays compared to morning schedules
